Credit Card Fraud Detection

This data set is enconded, so we wont be finding time series instead we will
redirect our focus on random forest classifiers,extra tress classifier,
Gradient boost etc.

This analysis looks at two major questions;

* How to detect credit card fraud?
* Which model is best for credit card fraud detection?



Highlights:


1. Import Libraries

2. Load dataset

3. Data Inspection

4. Feature selection/importances

5. Split data

6. Build Models

- Decision Tree Classifier

- Random Forest Classifier

- Gradient Boosting Classifier

- Final Model Selection and Justification
